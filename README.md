## Overview 
### Description
Our development team is SSH, a project team for CSE 110 in Spring 2019. We are creating a React Native app named Student and Student Housing (SSH) that would help UCSD students find off-campus houses. The app will support functionalities such as finding roomates, searching for houses, posting housings, and messaging. The app will showcase similar information as Airbnb.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Service
- **Mobile:** This app would be developed for both android and IOS using Rect Native. 
- **Story:** The application allows you to create a user profile and start input the user's personalities. User Data is pushed to the application and processed into an easily digestible form for users.
- **Market:** UCSD students who have trouble finding, subleasing or renting houses.
- **Habit:** This app would ideally be used at least once a day
- **Scope:** TODO
