## Description 
Our development team is named as SSH, a project team for CSE 110 in Spring 2019. We are creating a React Native app named Student and Student Housing (SSH) that would help UCSD students find off-campus houseing. The app will support functionalities such as finding roomates, searching for houses, posting housings, and messaging. The app will showcase similar information as Airbnb.
